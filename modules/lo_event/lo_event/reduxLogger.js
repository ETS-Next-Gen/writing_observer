/*
 * This is a logger which uses redux in order to route events to one
 * or more subscribers. It is currently used for working with the test
 * framework.
 *
 * In the future, our goal is to make this into a 'batteries included'
 * framework for developing `react`/`redux`/`lo_event` applications
 * which embodies good design practices for this domain.
 *
 * Our goal is NOT to be universal. Integrating `lo_event` into an
 * exiting `redux` workflow is â‰ˆ25 lines of code. This framework is
 * opinionated, and if there's a clash of opinions, you're better
 * off writing those 25 lines.
 *
 * Beyond test cases, the major use case is to make the development of
 * a broad class of simple educational activites, well, simple. For
 * larger applications, it probably makes more sense to start with
 * vanilla `react`/`redux`/`lo_event` without using this file, to just
 * use bits and pieces, or to treat this code as an examplar.
