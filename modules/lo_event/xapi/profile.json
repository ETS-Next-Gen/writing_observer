    "description": "The mission of this Early Childhood Education (ECE) xAPI Profile is to define a shared vocabulary that allow the recording of the most common events that take place on a daily basis in an ECE school. This profile adds specific information for the collection of relevant data by tools that allow the tracking and monitoring of the evolution of children from ages 0 to 6. In this context, educators and parents or legal guardian have clearly distinct roles. The educator acts fundamentally as the recorder of events that take place in the classroom while the parents or legal guardian act as the consumers of that information. \n\nIn a more specific manner, the main goal of the ECE-xAPI Profile is to make the following representation easier:\n\n - Care interactions (e.g. change a diaper)\n\n - Educational interactions (e.g. participating in an activity)\n\n - Assessment of the progress and achievements reached by the child\n\n - Multimedia documentation of observations\n\n - Exchange of messages between educators and families\n\n",

Normally an Activity is only shared when it will have the same meaning to everyone, as a single word (English or not) a tag naturally has the same meaning.\n\nTo create an Activity under this profile simply use the format: `http://id.tincanapi.com/activity/tags/<your word>`. Then use the same word in the Activity Definition 'name' property with the 'und' (undefined) language map code for the language. The corresponding Activity looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"http://id.tincanapi.com/activity/tags/<your word>\",\n    \"definition\": {\n        \"name\": {\n            \"und\": \"<your word>\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"objectType\": \"Activity\"\n}\n```",
