This code is open source. The license is TBD. You're obviously welcome to use it under the AGPL, like the rest of the Learning Observer and Writing Observer.

For this specific module, we would like to also include a more permissive license in the future. That's TBD. If you'd like to use it under a more permissive license right now, please contact us, and we can try to make the future be now.

If you contribute code specifically to `lo_event`, you should be aware we will probably license all code in `lo_event` under a more permissive (but AGPL-compatible) license, and you should make sure that you are okay with that before contributing. We would like proprietary systems to be able to use `lo_event` to stream into the _Learning Observer_, so this is necessary.

(The rest of the system is AGPLv3, and we would need to seperately ask permission from all contributors for a relicense; we don't want that same constraint here.)
