This code is open source. The license is TBD. You're obviously welcome to use it under the AGPL, like the rest of the Learning Observer and Writing Observer.

For this specific module, we would like to also include a more permissive license in the future. That's TBD. If you'd like to use it under a more permissive license right now, please contact us, and we can try to make the future be now.
