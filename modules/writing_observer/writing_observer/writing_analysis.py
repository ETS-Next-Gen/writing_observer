# How do we count the last action in a document? If a student steps away
# for hours, we don't want to count all those hours.
#
# We might e.g. assume a one minute threshold. If students are idle
# for more than a minute, we count one minute. If less, we count the
# actual time spent. So if a student goes away for an hour, we count
# that as one minute. This threshold sets that maximum. For debugging,
# a few seconds is convenient. For production use, 60-300 seconds (or
# 1-5 minutes) might be more reasonable.

#
# In edX, for time-on-task calculations, the exact threshold had a
# surprisingly small impact on any any sort of interpretation
# (e.g. all the numbers would go up/down 20%, but behavior was
# substantatively identical).

# Should be 60-300 in prod. 5 seconds is nice for debugging
