Early Prototypes and Draft Code
===============================

This is a place for unfinished code... I don't commit most prototypes,
but once something is discussion-worthy or a good starting point, I
sometimes do.

Prototypes and proofs-of-concept:

* Help scope out future work
* Help understand capabilities and limitations
* Help us learn
* Are sometimes starting points for implementation

Code here is of mixed quality, obviously.
