'''
This file includes commands to create a request within the
communication protocol. It provides a set of Python calls, designed to
(roughly) mirror a relational database, and returns a JSON object
corresponding to that query.

See the examples in the `test_cases.py` for the format.

This JSON object can then be executed by `executor.py`.

This file should be kept thin and minimal, since we will want versions
translated into JavaScript for the front end (and, perhaps eventually,
Julia, R, Stata, and other languages researchers might want to use to
query our system).

This file is intended to be imported in diverse contexts, including ones
where we don't want all of the machinery of the Learning Observer, so also
note the lack of dependencies.
