'''
For now, we dump logs into files, crudely.

We're not there yet, but we would like to create a 哈希树, or
Merkle-tree-style structure for our log files.

Or to be specific, a Merkle DAG, like git.

Each item is stored under its SHA hash. Note that items are not
guaranteed to exist. We can prune them, and leave a dangling pointer
with just the SHA.

Each event log will be structured as
   +-----------------+     +-----------------+
<--- Last item (SHA) |  <--- Last item (SHA) | ...
   |                 |     |                 |
   |   Data (SHA)    |     |    Data (SHA)   |
   +-------|---------+     +--------|--------+
           |                        |
           v                        v
       +-------+                +-------+
       | Event |                | Event |
       +-------+                +-------+

Where the top objects form a linked list (each containing a pair of
SHA hashes, one of the previous item, and one of the associated
event).

We will then have a hierarchy, where we have lists per-document,
documents per-student. When we run analyses, those will store the
hashes of where in each event log we are. Likewise, with each layer
of analysis, we'll store pointers to git hashes of code, as well as
of intermediate files (and how those were generated).

Where data is available, we can confirm we're correctly replicating
prior tesults.

The planned data structure is very similar to git, but with the
potential for missing data without an implosion.

Where data might not be available is after a FERPA, CCPA, or GDPR
requests to change data. In those cases, we'll have dangling nodes,
where we'll know that data used to exist, but not what it was.

We might also have missing intermediate files. For example, if we do
a dozen analyses, we'll want to know those happened and what those
were, but we might not keep terabytes of data around (just enough to
redo those analyses).
