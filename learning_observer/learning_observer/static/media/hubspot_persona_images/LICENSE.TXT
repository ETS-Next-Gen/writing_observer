These images are from HubSpot's free Make My Persona tool.

These have unclear licensing. HubSpot has "Copright (c) 2020 HubSpot
Inc." at the bottom of the page, but no other text there (not even All
Rights Reserved). There is no license file anywhere we could
find. There were many implicit grants in other places e.g. "Create a
buyer persona that your entire company can use to market, sell, and
serve better" which made this use seem okay, so we reached out to
HubSpot to confirm this use was okay.

HubSpot explicitly confirmed that we were in the clear for UX
prototypes, mockups, and personas. Chat transcript below.

However, these are NOT distributed under the same license as the rest
of the project. For licensing information, please contact HubSpot
directly.

My expectation (as of this writing) is that we will NOT use these
avatars beyond mockups, prototypes, and testing. If we go beyond that,
we may revisit.

The rest of the mockup personas incorporated information from several
such tools. The rest were clearly okay.

Thank you HubSpot!

  Great, a coach is on their way now. Theyâ€™ll send a message
  when they get here, so I appreciate your patience in the meantime.

  Hi Peter, this is Ali from HubSpot Sales. I'm happy to point you in the right direction today.

  I just had a quick question: you have a bunch of free tools, like a
  person generator. If we use them, are we allowed to use the personas
  however we like? Or are there licensing restrictions?

  They say nothing, and if it's All Rights Reserved, we're not allowed
  to use them for anything. Which sort of makes them pointless. Or I'm
  not sure. https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona It's a nice tool,
  but there's no legal information


3:42 PM Ali
  You would be creating your buyer persona for your own company, no one
  else would see it if you use the generator to create a buyer persona
  then there aren't legal restrictions


3:43 PM
  Okay. Thank you. I'm building an open source educational tool, and I
  wanted to share some UX mock-ups and prototypes, including user
  personas from the tool (obviously not open-sourcing the personas
  themselves). It sounds like that's okay then?

3:45 PM Ali
  Yes that is definitely okay Peter 

3:47 PM
  Thank you so much!
