'''Authorization / authentication subsystem.

Our goal is to keep things simple. We would like a few types of accounts:

- Student (guest)
- Student (authorized)
- Teacher
- System admin
- In the future, researchers

We really don't want this blowing up into massive ACLs and
what-not. There is a broad set of use-cases for Learning Observer,
including:

* Web pages on the internet with no log-ins, and per-session "accounts"
* Small-scale deploys, with config in flat files for individual classes
* Research coglabs and studies
* Large-scale deploys integrated with school subsystems through single
  sign-on

Currently, we're developing the system to handle all of these
use-cases through configuration (e.g. different deploy for each of
these). Eventually, we'd like to handle all of these in one common
deploy, so we can cross-link, aggregate, and understand what's going
on across contexts, but there's a lot of architecture and planning work
to get there.

It's worth noting that there are two types of security:

1) **Students injecting data into the system**. Here, in many
   use-cases, lack of auth is low-stakes. The worst-case outcome in,
   for example, a cog lab, is a DoS attack. Stakes only go up if data
   is used for e.g. decisionmaking. For this reason, student auth/auth
   supports modes which are pretty lax. On the other hand, in many
   contexts, we won't have good data (e.g.  open web pages without
   sign-ins).

2) **Access to student data**. For authenticating teachers and sys
   admins, we want full paranoia.

We do want to be aware of corner-cases (e.g. students wanting access
to their own data).

We haven't figured out all of the data models here.
