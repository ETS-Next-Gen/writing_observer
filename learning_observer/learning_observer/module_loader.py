Import analytics modules

This runs _after_ `paths` and `settings`, since `settings` calls
`learning_observer.paths.register_repo`, which we use here.

Ideally, this would be more modular and run without a settings file
too. We'd like to use this from utility scripts.

    There's a little bit of complexity and nuance in how we'd
    like to manage branches.

    In deployment / operational settings:

    - We'll want to be careful about WHICH branch and commit we
    serve. We don't want students, teachers, or search engines
    navigating all versions willy nilly.
    - This is primarily a research platform. In research settings,
    we usually DO want to allow users to go to different versions.
    This is helpful for research replicability ("what version did
    Subject 42 see?"), for the social practice of research (e.g.
    show a collaborator a prototype, while using IRB-approved
    versions for coglabs), for experiments (e.g. show different
    versions to different students), etc.

    For now, this is set up around the *research* use-case: Being able
    to run coglabs, small pilots, and similar, used in controlled
    settings, without confidential items in repos.

    Note that since this is all open-source, hosting static files from
    a repo is *typically* *not* a security issue. It can be a usability
    issue, though (e.g. if users find an outdated link via a search
    engine).

    (Of course, YMMV. If you're hosting test items in a repo, then you
    want to be very careful about security)\
