'''
This was designed as a helper for per-thread connection pooling (we want
just one redis connection). This was necessary with asyncio_redis. We ported
to redis.asyncio, and right now, a lot of this design and code is obsolete.
Right now, it's easy to switch around, but this should be modernized once we're
confident using redis.asyncio. It handles a lot of what we do manually inside
the library.
