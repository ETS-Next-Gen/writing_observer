    This is the main event decoder. It is called by the
    websocket handler to log events.

    Parameters:
        request: The request object.
        headers: The header events, which e.g. contain auth
        metadata: Metadata about the request, such as IP. This is
            extracted from the request, which will go away soon.

    Returns:
        A coroutine that decodes and logs events.

    We call this after the header events, with the header events in the
    `headers` parameter. This is because we want to log the header events
    before the body events, so they can be dropped from the Merkle tree
    for privacy. Although in most cases, students can be reidentified
    from the body events, the header events contain explicit identification
    tokens. It is helpful to be able to analyze data with these dropped,
    obfuscated, or otherwise anonymized.

    At present, many body events contain auth as well. We'll want to minimize
    this and tag those events appropriately.

    HACK: We would like clean log files for the first classroom pilot.

    This puts events in per-session files.

    The feature flag has the non-hack implementation.
