'''
Class Roster Subsystem
======================

This gives class roster information:

- What classes a teach administrates
- Which students are in a class.

We can either retrieve class rosters from:

- Google Classroom                      (config setting: 'google')
- Text files on the disk for testing.   (config setting: 'test')
  We have two files:
  - courses.json
  - students.json
- A file hierarchy, for small-scale deploys.  ('filesystem')
- In progress: All students, for e.g. coglabs, experiments, and
  similar  ('all')

In the future, we might want:

- more integrations
- a database option
- an option to autocreate "guest" users (for unauthenticated deploys)

As well as the option for several sources in the same system, perhaps.

This file could be cleaned up a lot. Right now, we do a lot of this by
mock calls to Google AJAX. It also contains a large number of hacks which
we use to manage the data and to address variations in the roster sources
whether we are taking them from google or from our own backup data.

As of now this partially implements a separation between the internal ID
which shows up in our rosters as id or `user_id` and the id used for the
external sources of data.  We store external ids on student data under
external_ids and keep space for ids from google etc.  However as of now
we do not make use of it.  Ultimately it would be ideal to move so that
remote data retreival and raw document storage are done under an internal
id with this translation taking place at event storage time *or* that the
event retreival by the dashboard makes use of the external ids consistently
at composition time.  The latter approach however has the cost that we would
be redoing the lookup and indexing each time we pull the raw data. This has
the potential to create some extra, though probably manageable, queries.

In either case we get around it now by also adding in a cheap hack that
makes the internal ID for google-sourced users match the google ID. This
will need to change in a stable way for future use.

Note that these APIs and file locations aren't finished. In the future,
we may:

* Switch from .json to .yaml
* Have a less Googley format

As it stands this file is also part of the way through a naming refactor.
The roster information has changed from camel-case to underscores. The
actual group information has not. That should also be remapped and tested
so that class info uses the same format but that is scut work for another
time.
