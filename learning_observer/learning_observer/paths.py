'''
Path hierarchy
==============

Helper utility to help manage paths. We'd like to abstract out path
configurations so that the tool can work in:

1. Deployed settings
2. pip installs
3. Development mode

... etc.

This abstracts out finding files and directories. Eventually, we'd
like to be able to search for packages looking at:

- Relative directories (e.g. when developing)
- Static directories (e.g. /etc/, /var/log/, etc.)
- Config file
- pkg_resources
- Command-line parameters

It makes sense to put this logic one place.

Should this be merges with settings.py? Let's see how complex this gets.
