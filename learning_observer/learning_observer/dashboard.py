    We would like to be able to support pretty arbitrary dashboards,
    where the client asks for a subset of data and we send it.

    This is probably the wrong abstraction, but our goal is to allows
    arbitrary dashboards client-side.

    We're figuring out what we're doing. This view is behind a feature
    flag, since we have no clear idea.

    Our goal is to be able to set up appropriate queries to deliver
    pretty generic aggregations.

    The current model has the client ask for specific data, and for us
    to send it back. However, the concept of doing this more server-side
    makes a lot of sense too.

    GraphQL looks super-relevant. Implementing it is a big lift, and
    it might need to be slightly adapted to the context.

    The test case for this is in `util/generic_websocket_dashboard.py`
