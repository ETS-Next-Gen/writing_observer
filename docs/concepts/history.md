Second prototype
-------

The second prototype integrated with Google Classroom, and presented a
(less pretty, more cluttered) consolidated view with:

* Current student typing
* Time-on-task, idle time, and text length

First prototype
-------

Our first version of the tool was a UX mockup (with real front-end
code, but no backend). We had five tabs, of which two are shown. The
typing view showed a block of text around the student cursor in
real-time

The outline view showed section titles, and how much text students had
written in each section. 

In addition, we had a view which showed summary stats (e.g. amount of
text written), contact info for students, as well as a visualization
of the students' writing process. Teachers wanted a streamlines view
which showed just text around the cursor and three of the summary
stats (amount of text written, idle time, and time-on-task). Most of
the other stuff felt like too much.
