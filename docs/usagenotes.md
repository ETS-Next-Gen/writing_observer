## Usage Notes.

For the moment this doc will act as some shared working knowledge for the use of the system with students.


# Extension Security.

NOTE: The current working version of the chrome extension requires that the user is logged into both a Google account (which is registered to the classroom) *and* Chrome.  This requirement stems from the security model used by the extension.  On Chromebook devices this is the default behavior.  In future work other devices will require a change.
