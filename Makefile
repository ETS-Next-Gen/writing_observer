	# Just a little bit of dependency hell...

	# The AWE Components are built using a specific version of
	# `spacy`. This requires an out-of-date `typing-extensions`
	# package. There are few other dependecies that require a
	# newer version. As far as I can tell, upgrading this package
	# does not effect the functionality we receive from the AWE
	# components.
	# TODO remove this extra step after AWE Component's `spacy`
	# is no longer version locked.
	# This is no longer an issue, but we will leave until all
	# dependecies can be resolved in the appropriate locations.
