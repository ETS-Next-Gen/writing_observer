gitserve
========

This is a small module to (t.b.d. access? serve?) files from git.

Perhaps it belongs in a different repo?

It's not designed to be particular fast, scalable, or robust in the
current implementation. It wouldn't be hard to make it be so, if that
were a requirement down-the-line. For now, I'd like to be able to do
small-scale studies where I can serve up files from a git repo, and
have versions appropriately managed.
