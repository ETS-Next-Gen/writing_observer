  strategy and user needs translate into an overall system approach.
- :doc:`Architecture <docs/concepts/architecture>` - outlines the concrete
  architecture that implements the system design.
- :doc:`Technologies <docs/concepts/technologies>` - surveys the primary tools
  and platforms we rely on to realize the architecture.
- :doc:`System Settings <docs/concepts/system_settings>` - describes how the
  system loads global and cascading settings.
- :doc:`Events <docs/concepts/events>` - introduces the event model that drives
  data flowing through the system.
- :doc:`Reducers <docs/concepts/reducers>` - details how incoming events are
  aggregated into the state our experiences depend on.
- :doc:`Communication Protocol <docs/concepts/communication_protocol>` - discusses how
  the system queries data from reducers for dashboards.
- :doc:`Scaling <docs/concepts/scaling>` - covers strategies for growing the
  system once the fundamentals are in place.
